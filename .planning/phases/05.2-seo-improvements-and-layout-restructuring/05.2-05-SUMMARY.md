# Phase 05.2 Plan 05: LeftSidebar Component Summary

**LeftSidebar component with Bulgarian-formatted official holidays and school vacation periods, using Coffee theme visual indicators**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 51 seconds
- **Started:** 2026-02-07T09:45:47Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-07T09:46:38Z
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Created LeftSidebar component for displaying holiday information
- Official holidays section with cinnamon dot indicators
- School vacations section with teal dot indicators
- Bulgarian date formatting using date-fns bg locale with proper capitalization
- Server-compatible component receiving data via props

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create LeftSidebar component** - `feaf529` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `components/LeftSidebar.tsx` - Server component displaying official holidays and school vacation periods with Bulgarian date formatting

## Decisions Made

**Date Display Format:**
- Official holidays: "1 Януари 2026 – Нова година" (date + year + name)
- School vacations: "4 Април – 13 Април – Пролетна ваканция" (date range + name)
- Rationale: Clear, readable format that provides all necessary information at a glance

**Visual Indicators:**
- Cinnamon dot (bg-cinnamon) for official holidays - matches calendar cell holiday color
- Teal dot (bg-teal) for school vacations - matches calendar cell school holiday color
- Rationale: Visual consistency between sidebar list and calendar cells

**Component Architecture:**
- Server Component (no 'use client' directive)
- Receives holidays, schoolHolidays, and year as props
- Rationale: Presentational component with no interactivity can remain server-rendered

**Bulgarian Date Formatting:**
- Use date-fns bg locale for proper month names
- Capitalize month names using charAt(0).toUpperCase()
- Rationale: Bulgarian convention requires capitalized month names in formatted dates

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- LeftSidebar component ready for integration into page layout (Plan 05.2-06)
- Component accepts holidays and schoolHolidays data as props
- Visual design consistent with Coffee theme tokens
- Date formatting follows established Safari-safe parseISO pattern
