[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Page Title Removed from Visible UI
expected: No visible page title or subtitle text rendered on the page. The browser tab still shows the dynamic Bulgarian title. Only the auth button appears at top-right on both mobile and desktop.
result: issue
reported: "Title and description text should still be visible but moved to above the year selector (← 2026 →) within the main content area — not in sidebars or header. Should match the same width in desktop and mobile. Text: 'Празнични, неучебни и неработни дни през 2026 г.' + description paragraph."
severity: major

### 2. Three-Column Desktop Layout - Centered
expected: On desktop, three columns (left sidebar | calendar | right sidebar) are centered on the page with breathing room. They don't stretch to full width on ultra-wide screens. Columns are brought together, not spread apart.
result: pass
note: "Pass but needs more margin-bottom between the header (auth button) and the three-column content. They are grouped too closely together."

### 3. Left Sidebar - Two Separate Cards
expected: Left sidebar shows TWO separate cards with visible gap between them: "Официални празници" card on top, "Ученически ваканции" card below. Each card has box-shadow and same styling as the Легенда card (border, rounded corners, shadow).
result: pass

### 4. Left Sidebar - No Scrollbar
expected: Left sidebar has NO internal scrollbar. Both cards stack naturally. Sidebar uses sticky positioning while you scroll through the calendar months — same behavior as the right sidebar.
result: issue
reported: "Sticky works but wrong behavior. Left sidebar should scroll with the page until the full Ученически ваканции card is visible, THEN become sticky. Currently it sticks immediately at the top. Want scroll-then-stick: sidebar scrolls naturally until all content is in view, then locks in place."
severity: minor

### 5. Legend Holiday Swatch - No П Text
expected: The legend's "Официален празник" swatch is a plain solid cinnamon-colored square with NO text inside. Just a colored block, like all other legend swatches.
result: pass

### 6. Vacation Color Distinct from Bridge
expected: In the legend AND calendar, "Лична почивка" (vacation) color is clearly different from "Предложение за почивка" (bridge). Vacation is now a green tone, bridge is honey/amber. Easy to tell apart at a glance.
result: pass

### 7. School Holidays - Weekdays Only
expected: School holiday teal highlighting in the calendar appears ONLY on weekdays (Monday-Friday). Saturday and Sunday cells within school holiday periods show as regular weekends (cream), not teal.
result: pass

### 8. No Summer Vacation in Calendar
expected: The calendar does NOT show "Лятна ваканция" (summer vacation, roughly May-September). Those months should NOT be flooded with teal. Only shorter school holiday periods (Коледна, Пролетна, etc.) appear.
result: issue
reported: "Лятна ваканция correctly not in calendar, but it should still appear in the Ученически ваканции sidebar card. Also missing school holidays in the calendar: Dec 29-31 and May 24. The Лятна ваканция filter should only exclude from calendar dates, not from the sidebar list. All school holidays including Лятна ваканция should show in the sidebar."
severity: major

### 9. Weekend Holidays - Cinnamon on Both Days
expected: If a holiday falls on Saturday or Sunday, that weekend day shows with cinnamon color (not regular weekend cream). The transferred Monday ALSO shows with cinnamon color. Both the weekend day and Monday show the holiday tooltip.
result: pass
note: "Tooltip on Monday cells gets cut off by calendar overflow:hidden. Needs position fix so tooltip isn't clipped by the MonthGrid container boundary."

### 10. Bridge + School Holiday Split Cell
expected: If a bridge day suggestion and a school holiday overlap on the same calendar cell, the cell shows a diagonal split with both colors — bridge (honey) on one half and school (teal) on the other half.
result: pass

### 11. Mobile Tooltip - Exclamation Icon
expected: On mobile (narrow screen), holiday cells show a small "!" icon at the top-right corner. Tapping the "!" toggles the tooltip. Tapping it does NOT trigger vacation drag selection. Desktop hover behavior unchanged.
result: issue
reported: "Works but wrong icon. The mobile icon should use the same 'i' icon as desktop, not an exclamation mark '!'. User meant the same info icon style for both mobile and desktop."
severity: cosmetic

### 12. Mobile Content Width Matches Calendar
expected: On mobile, all content sections (Легенда, Лична почивка, sidebar cards, year selector) are constrained to the same width as the calendar. Only the header (auth button) stays full-width. Everything else is centered.
result: issue
reported: "Widths are close but not equal. Calendar has px-4 and py-6 padding which makes it visually different from legend and other sections. All sections should use the same padding so they align perfectly on mobile."
severity: cosmetic

### 13. Regression - Vacation Drag Selection
expected: You can still click/drag to select vacation days on the calendar. Selected days show in the new green vacation color. The vacation summary updates correctly. Drag selection works on both desktop and mobile.
result: issue
reported: "Drag selection works but: (1) Should NOT work for non-current years — disable vacation editing and drag selection when viewing past or future years via year selector. (2) Лична почивка does not change and its edit icon is not visible."
severity: major
