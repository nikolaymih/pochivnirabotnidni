# Phase 5.2 Plan 09: Remove Title, Center Layout, Split LeftSidebar Summary

**One-liner:** Removed visible h1/subtitle from page, centered three-column desktop layout with max-w-[1400px], split LeftSidebar into 2 separate cards, added mobile max-w-[650px] wrapper.

## What Was Done

### Task 1: Split LeftSidebar into 2 cards
- Changed LeftSidebar return from single `<div>` to React Fragment with 2 separate card divs
- Card 1: Official Holidays (Официални празници)
- Card 2: School Vacations (Ученически ваканции) - conditionally rendered
- Both cards styled with `p-4 bg-white rounded-lg border border-latte shadow-sm` matching Legend/VacationSummary
- Removed `mb-6` from first `<ul>` (no longer needed with separate cards)
- School vacations card has `mt-4` for spacing between cards

### Task 2: Restructure page.tsx layout
- Removed all `<h1>` elements from both mobile and desktop layouts
- Removed `<p>` subtitle elements from both layouts
- Removed `PAGE_TITLE, PAGE_SUBTITLE, PAGE_DESCRIPTION` import (no longer used in page.tsx; layout.tsx still uses PAGE_TITLE for metadata)
- Desktop: Added `max-w-[1400px] mx-auto` to header and three-column container for centered layout
- Desktop: Changed column gap from `gap-4` to `gap-6` for better breathing room
- Desktop: Removed `overflow-y-auto` and `max-h-[calc(100vh-2rem)]` from left sidebar wrapper
- Mobile: Replaced separate padded divs with single `max-w-[650px] mx-auto px-4` content wrapper
- Mobile: Auth header right-aligned with `justify-end` instead of `justify-between` (no title to left-align against)
