<objective>
Implement vacation day rollover for authenticated users and ensure anonymous users see no rollover UI.

Purpose: Authenticated users get the benefit of cross-device data persistence AND vacation rollover - unused days from the previous year carry forward. This is a key differentiator for signing in. Anonymous users see nothing about this feature (per CONTEXT.md: "Anonymous users see nothing about rollover feature - invisible, not grayed out").

Output: Rollover calculation utility, enhanced VacationContext with rollover, and updated VacationSummary showing rolled-over days for authenticated users.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create rollover calculation and integrate into VacationContext</name>
  <files>
    lib/vacation/rollover.ts
    contexts/VacationContext.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    1. Create `lib/vacation/rollover.ts`:
       - Import `fetchVacationData` from `./sync`
       - Import `VacationData` from `./types`

       Define `RolloverResult`:
       ```typescript
       export interface RolloverResult {
         rolloverDays: number;       // Unused days from previous year
         previousYearTotal: number;  // Previous year's total allowance
         previousYearUsed: number;   // Previous year's used days
       }
       ```

       Export `calculateRollover(userId: string, currentYear: number): Promise<RolloverResult | null>`:
       - Fetch previous year data: `fetchVacationData(userId, currentYear - 1)`
       - If no previous year data: return null (no rollover available)
       - Calculate:
         ```
         previousYearUsed = prevData.vacationDates.length
         rolloverDays = Math.max(0, prevData.totalDays - previousYearUsed)
         ```
       - Return `{ rolloverDays, previousYearTotal: prevData.totalDays, previousYearUsed }`
       - If rolloverDays is 0: return null (nothing to roll over)

    2. Update `contexts/VacationContext.tsx`:
       - Extend `VacationContextType` interface:
         ```typescript
         interface VacationContextType {
           vacationData: VacationData;
           setVacationData: (data: VacationData) => void;
           rollover: RolloverResult | null;  // NEW
           isAuthenticated: boolean;          // NEW
         }
         ```
       - Import `calculateRollover`, `RolloverResult` from `@/lib/vacation/rollover`
       - Add useState for `rollover` (RolloverResult | null, default null)

       Add rollover calculation effect (runs after cloud data loads):
       ```
       useEffect(() => {
         if (!user || isLoadingCloud) return
         calculateRollover(user.id, currentYear)
           .then(result => setRollover(result))
           .catch(err => console.error('Rollover check failed:', err))
       }, [user, isLoadingCloud, currentYear])
       ```

       - When user signs out: reset rollover to null
       - Pass `rollover` and `isAuthenticated` in the context value

       NOTE: This is a MINOR interface extension. Existing consumers that don't use `rollover` or `isAuthenticated` will continue working. The `vacationData` and `setVacationData` properties remain unchanged.
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npm run build` succeeds
    - `lib/vacation/rollover.ts` exports `calculateRollover` and `RolloverResult`
    - VacationContext provides `rollover` and `isAuthenticated` fields
    - Anonymous flow still works (rollover is null, isAuthenticated is false)
  </verify>
  <done>
    Rollover calculation fetches previous year data from Supabase and computes unused days. VacationContext exposes rollover result and auth state to downstream components.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update VacationSummary to show rollover for authenticated users</name>
  <files>
    components/VacationSummary.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
    Update `components/VacationSummary.tsx`:
    - Import `rollover` and `isAuthenticated` from `useVacation()` (destructure new fields)

    Modify the summary display:
    - Keep ALL existing UI unchanged for anonymous users
    - For authenticated users with rollover (rollover !== null and rollover.rolloverDays > 0):
      - Add a new row AFTER "Общо дни за отпуск" row:
        ```
        "Прехвърлени от {previousYear}: {rollover.rolloverDays} дни"
        (Carried over from {year}: X days)
        ```
      - Style: text-sm text-purple-600 or similar accent color
      - Adjust remaining days calculation to include rollover:
        ```
        const effectiveTotal = vacationData.totalDays + (rollover?.rolloverDays || 0)
        const remainingDays = effectiveTotal - usedDays
        const percentageUsed = effectiveTotal > 0 ? Math.round((usedDays / effectiveTotal) * 100) : 0
        ```
      - Show effective total in the "Общо дни за отпуск" display:
        ```
        "{totalDays} + {rolloverDays} прехвърлени = {effectiveTotal}"
        ```
        Only when rollover exists. Without rollover, just show totalDays as before.

    - For anonymous users: ALL rollover UI is INVISIBLE (not grayed out, not mentioned at all)
      - Check: `if (!isAuthenticated || !rollover)` then render exactly the same as before
      - Per CONTEXT.md: "Anonymous users see nothing about rollover feature (invisible, not grayed out)"

    IMPORTANT:
    - Do NOT add any banner, tooltip, or message encouraging anonymous users to sign in
    - Per CONTEXT.md: "No proactive messaging - no banners, tooltips, or callouts about sign-in benefits"
    - Keep existing edit functionality (totalDays editing) working unchanged
    - Keep existing Tailwind styling patterns
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `npm run build` succeeds
    - Anonymous user sees the EXACT same VacationSummary as before (no rollover mention)
    - Authenticated user with previous year data sees rollover line
    - Remaining days calculation accounts for rollover
    - Edit total days still works
  </verify>
  <done>
    VacationSummary shows rollover days for authenticated users who have previous year data. Anonymous users see the identical summary as before with zero reference to rollover. Remaining days calculation includes rollover when applicable.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- `npm run build` succeeds
- Anonymous user experience is UNCHANGED (no rollover mention anywhere)
- Authenticated user with previous year data sees "Прехвърлени от {year}: X дни" in summary
- Remaining days includes rollover for authenticated users
- Rollover is calculated once on load, not on every render
- Edit total days still works for both anonymous and authenticated users
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Authenticated users see rolled-over vacation days from the previous year in VacationSummary. Rollover adds unused days to their effective total. Anonymous users see absolutely nothing about rollover (invisible, not grayed out, no messaging). The existing VacationSummary UI is unchanged for anonymous users.
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/04-authentication-and-cross-device-sync/04-04-SUMMARY.md`
