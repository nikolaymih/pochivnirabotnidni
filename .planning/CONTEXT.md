# Project Context

## Fast Lane Contract

Fast Lane = small, low-risk changes (UI copy, CSS, tiny refactors).
Not allowed: data flow, APIs, schemas, auth, business logic, architecture.

Rules:
- Do NOT modify ROADMAP.md structure
- Do NOT rewrite PLAN.md / SUMMARY.md (except full phases)
- Fast Lane changes are provisional until absorbed by a full phase

Canonical truth: ROADMAP.md + phase PLAN.md + phase SUMMARY.md

## Fast Lane Review (required in every full GSD phase plan)

When planning any full GSD phase, PLAN.md must include a required step:

```
Fast Lane review:
- Reviewed FAST_LANE.md up to: YYYY-MM-DD
- Decision: absorb / reapply / ignore (list entry dates)
```

This ensures provisional fast-lane changes are explicitly reconciled before new phase work begins.
